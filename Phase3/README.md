# README file for Project1.1 Group 20 Phase 3

## Project Details
This program can be used to calculate the chromatic number of a graph. the program contains several algorithms that are used to aquire lower and upper bounds to the chromatic number as well as algorithms that try to achieve the exact chromatic number.

The program will keep improving the lower and upper bounds until the exact chromatic number is reached. As soon as an exact is aquired, program execution is stopped, and the exact chromatic number is returned. 


## Program Execution
All files in the src folder should be compiled using javac fileName.java in the command prompt.

The run the program, call the java RunCode textFileName.txt command in the command prompt.

The folder also contains a .jar file with all the code. To run this use java -jar Group20.jar textFileName.txt
